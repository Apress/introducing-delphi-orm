Git Commit Writing Guide
Git commit messages follow the general guidelines widely available (atomic commits, imperative writing style, etc.)

In addition, commits can use the following semantics:

Commit		Element	Equivalent							Commit Message Example
+			Add										+ methods to calculate ratios
-			Remove										- redundant calls to API
*			Update										* project files
Dolphins	Used to describe that the commit has 
			some necessary changes but nothing 
			relevant (eg. a blank line was added, 
			the newly saved file has rearranged 
			elements in the settings file, etc.)

			Use this when the modified files in the 
			commit have just "indescribable" changes
